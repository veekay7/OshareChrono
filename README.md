# Chrono

Chrono was developed for a UI/UX programming challenge. The challenge was to make a clock application that was to be used at work.
I designed the UI, UI layout, the radial graphic and coded it.

## Features:

- Bauhaus-inspired display with radial design.
  - Innermost circle represents the hour. The circle changes colours depending on the time of day to represent the day-night cycle. It changes to blue when the time is 6:30 P.M (to represent night) and turns red when the time is 6:30 a.m. (to represent day time).
  - Middle ring represents the minutes.
  - Outer ring represents the seconds.
- 12-hour digital format.
- User's current time zone display.
- Shows the user's current time in their timezone.
- From the inside: Innermost is Hour, middle ring represents the Minute and outer most
